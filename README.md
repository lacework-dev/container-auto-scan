# Lacework Auto Scanner

![Build Status](https://github.com/lacework-dev/container-auto-scan/actions/workflows/python-test.yml/badge.svg)
![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/alannix/container-auto-scan)

The aim of this project is to make it simple to trigger vulnerability assessments for containers which are active and have integrated container registries in Lacework.

## How It Works

1. The script will download a report of all scanned containers a defined "look-back" period. Containers that have already been scanned will be skipped by default. This can be overwritten with the `--rescan` flag.
2. The script will enumerate all integrated container registries, gathering the domains that can be scanned. This can be overwritten with the `--registry <registry_domain>` argument.
3. The script will run a query against the specified Lacework account to gather distinct container repository/tag combinations that have run in the environment over the "look-back" period for the integrated domains.
4. The script will then issue container scan requests for the un-scanned active containers via the Lacework API.

The default "look-back" period is 1 day, but can be augmented with the `--days <num_of_days>` or `--hours <num_of_hours>` arguments.

## How To Run

### Local Execution

The easiest way to run this script is by executing it as a container using Lacework API credentials provided from your Lacework CLI configuration:

```bash
docker run -v ~/.lacework.toml:/home/user/.lacework.toml alannix/container-auto-scan
```

This will mount your Lacework CLI credentials into the container and execute the scan on the default profile. You can, of course, pass in a different profile with the `-p <profile>` argument as outlined [here](#user-content-arguments). Or you can provide credentials using the `--account`, `--subaccount`, `--api-key`, `--api-secret` arguments.

The script can also read the standard Lacework CLI environment variables for authentication as outlined [here](#user-content-environment-variables).

If cloning this repository, rather than using a container, you can run the script with the following usage:

```bash
usage: argmark [-h] [--account ACCOUNT] [--subaccount SUBACCOUNT] [--api-key API_KEY] [--api-secret API_SECRET] [-p PROFILE] [--proxy-scanner PROXY_SCANNER] [--days DAYS] [--hours HOURS] [--registry REGISTRY] [--rescan] [--list-only] [-d] [--debug]
```

### Kubernetes Manifest

If you wish to run this script continuously, there is an example Kubernetes manifest in the [manifests](manifests/) directory which will store your Lacework API credentials as a Kubernetes Secret and then run the container in a Deployment with the `-d` flag to execute it as a daemon.

## Known Issues

- Due to Lacework API limitations, only 400 containers can be scanned in a single hour.
- Due to Lacework API limitations, only 5000 scanned container images (for de-duplication) will get returned.
- Due to Lacework API limitations, only 5000 container repo/tag combinations will get returned per registry.
